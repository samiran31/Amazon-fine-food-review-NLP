    "SpaCy provides classification model with multiple, non-mutually exclusive labels. You can change the model architecture rather easily, but by default, the TextCategorizer class uses a convolutional neural network to assign position-sensitive vectors to each word in the document. The TextCategorizer uses its own CNN model, to avoid sharing weights with the other pipeline components. The document tensor is then summarized by concatenating max and mean pooling, and a multilayer perceptron is used to predict an output vector of length nr_class, before a logistic activation is applied elementwise. The value of each output neuron is the probability that some class is present."

He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.

The ingredients are very pure: tomato puree, red bell peppers, tomatoes, yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic, cilantro, canola oil, guajillo chile peppers, sea salt, lime juice, habanero peppers, chile de arbol peppers, chilaca peppers, and black pepper. Notice that there are no chemicals, additives, substitutes or anything that is not natural. That's a big plus. The taste is ok. It tastes mostly like tomato sauce with a hint of pepper, and a hint of spice. On Guy's Heat-O-Meter it indicates that this salsa is Hot, but it's very mildly hot, unless you chew on one of the hottest peppers chunks. But overall it's pretty mild. I don't taste the cilantro or lime in it, it's mostly the tomato, onion, and the pepper. What I didn't like about it is that it's VERY watery, with hardly any chunks (see photo), and if I make a quesadilla the watery sauce drips everywhere. I like a more consistent salsa with chunks of vegetables in it that holds it together in a wrap. I gave it 3 stars for the list of pure ingredients and calorie count (2 tbsp - 10 calories, great for low calorie diets), and I took away 2 stars for the taste and consistency.\",\n",

It has a good, clean flavor you can only get from a full leaf tea like this.<br /><br />Now - a thing or two about Rishi's actual brewing instructions. This is the second Rishi tea I've tried, and like the first, the quality is great and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. If you follow Rishi's brewing instructions, however, you will get an overly potent, undrinkable mess instead of the mild, subtle yet undeniable flavor of a properly brewed green tea. Green tea isn't supposed to taste like the crap you get at Panera or from Lipton - you're not supposed to be assaulted by intense flavor when you drink it. If you follow Rishi's instructions though, that is what will happen and you'll probably end up writing reviews about how it tastes like grass.<br /><br />1 tablespoon per 8 ounces of water is beyond overkill. Brewing that for 3-4 minutes is even greater overkill. Like most other full leaf greens, 1 TEASPOON per 8 ounces of water brewed for between 1.5 to 2.5 minutes is what the brewing instructions on this tea should be. If I were to put 3 tablespoons of this stuff in my tetsubin and brew it for 4 minutes. . . I don't even want to know what would come out of the spout.<br /><br />So, 1 teaspoon/8 ounces of water for 1.5 - 2.5 minutes (2.5 is even pushing it) and you'll get an amazing green tea that has the subtlety and smoothness that you're supposed to get out of a green like this.

Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That\\'s a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is \"imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.\"<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the \"wet\" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).',\n",

It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA.

But I gave these a shot because I\\'m not willing to consume 4 cups of coffee a day with each having an extra 70 kcal shot of the regular syrup. That\\'s an extra 280 calories at the start of my day! But these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty calories.<br /><br />So I gave the variety pack a go, knowing I was sure to find a quick favorite.<br /><br />My favorite was the Vanilla. Sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be. I will definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />The Irish Cream was my second favorite out of the six. It adds an amazing creamy, buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die for.<br /><br />In third, was the Chocolate syrup. I am generally not a mocha fan so I used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first. But soon I was splashing in even more. It has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark variety.<br /><br />Next was the hazelnut. I am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor. It is a bit mediocre when compared to the more full-bodied syrups but will do in a pinch if you\\'re craving that touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Second to last we have the Classic Caramel. This was absolutely disappointing. I hoped for hints of cream and brown sugar, but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor. It did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven I desired. I have heard the Salted Caramel is much better, so that flavor has been added to my \"To-Try List\".<br /><br />Last is the raspberry, my least favorite. I am detested by the idea of fruity coffee (ei. blueberry, raspberry, etc.) so this was not a good coffee syrup for me. Instead, I decided to make raspberry tea with it. After several tries with black, green, and cranberry-pomegranate tea, I have decided this syrup just doesn\\'t work well. As most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee, you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea. And all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet. This was also the only flavor I actually tasted that sugar-free aftertaste, though possibly because I had to use so much.<br /><br />It\\'s hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavors.<br /><br />Overall though I say this sampler is great if you\\'re new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price. But if you already have established your favorites, I\\'d suggest buying their 3 pack of a single flavor at the same retail-reduced price of under $5 a bottle.',\n",

The maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins. Naturally the mineral and vitamin content will vary according to the area where the trees grow and the mineral content in the soil. These are the minerals found in average samples of syrup from Vermont: Sodium; Potassium; Calcium; Magnesium; Manganese; Iron; Copper; Chlorine and Silicon. Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C, Nicotinic acid and Pantothenic Acid are also present in the syrup... Some uninformed operators of the sugaring of the maple syrup do use formaldehyde pellets, run through polyethylene tubing but there are many more that don\\'t.

Overall, I think the product is great; my son seems to digest it better than the regular milk-based Similac. However, my BIGGEST complaint is that the design of these bottles really really SUCK! First of all, the foil -- once it opens, it leaves behind jagged edges (if you use the cap to open the foil). This causes the soy milk to pour unevenly out of the bottle, and creating a huge mess. And...since the foil is sealed so tightly around the mouth of the bottle, it's impossible to remove it completely. (Once I did try removing the foil completely... only to have foil bits fall into the soy milk. I was lucky to have seen the bits when I poured it into the baby bottle, otherwise it would've ended up in my baby's feed!!) So... instead of using the cap to open the foil, I've started using a sharp knife to cut a homemade spout into it - for easier pouring. Unfortunately, this method doesn't work either, since the milk has to travel over the lip of the bottle, and thus, it spills out all over the place. Again, huge mess. And especially since you're supposed to shake well before each use, there is milk all over the foil spout as you're pouring each feed. So yeah...BIG OL' HUGE MESS!!! Why are these bottles so difficult to pour?!?! Since we've started on Similac a few weeks ago, I have NOT had a good pour. With each feeding, enough of milk comes down the side of the baby bottle and the Similac bottle that I'm losing a whole ounce or two every time. Such a waste!!

Unlike the \"Shasta Black Cherry,\" this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn\\'t get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn\\'t get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 130 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn\\'t say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created 12 ounce cans and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.',\n",

I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work.

The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.\",\n",

I could only say I've known this taste before in... SpaghettiO's. Texture wise the pulp was also mushier, which has the benefit of a higher ratio of the rich, buttery bits, but I'm left wanting a hint of crunch somewhere. That's to be expected from young coconuts though, sought for their fruit rather than the mature nut. I favor a mix, which I at least believe I've found in two other brands. Another problem I found was these arrived in quite bad shape, the cans were variously dinged and punched in. The other guys' cans were too, except those were pressurized and so held up better. The real drawback for me was these practically require refrigeration.

After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it - who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.<br /><br />Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?<br /><br />One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.<br /><br />So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.<br /><br />The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.<br /><br />With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.<br /><br />This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give.\",\n",

Read closely regarding sugar content if the taste is not initially to your liking.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1****<br />I still think that this syrup does not have any pumpkin flavor and it tastes exactly like cinnamon red hot candies but the customer service I received was the best I have experienced.  Within an hour of posting my review, I received a call from one of the owners of the company.  He apologized for my disappointment and offered to replace my product with another.  When I finally spoke to him several days later, I had received some other syrups that I must say, exceeded my expectations.<br />I was never into vanilla, caramel or hazelnut flavors before but I didn\\'t realize why.  Comparing these flavors to the others I have tried in the past (namely, Torani) the Amoretti syrups tasted \"real\" and not like a chemical.  What is unique about their flavors is they are not overly sweet but they are full of flavor. I know I am not writing a review for the other flavors so I still hold my opinion that the pumpkin spice has no pumpkin flavor (I suggested to Paul on the phone that he consider changing the name to SPICE and leave out PUMPKIN entirely) however I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good the other flavors are.  So much so, that I brought my opened bottles of Torani to work to leave in the breakroom.<br />I am still hoping that Amoretti makes a pumpkin pie sauce syrup and if so, I will be first in line to buy it.<br />As for my other comments about the packaging, the new products I received were sealed with a plastic sleeve around the caps and the cap seals worked better too.  I still prefer a foil seal over the mouth of the bottle but seeing a change in the packaging so quickly based on customer comments was impressive.<br />As for the Amoretti flavors I would strongly suggest....Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup, Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup and Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup. I have never had creme syrups before and these are delicious.  I used the caramel and vanilla creme syrups over pumpkin and apple pies so they double as a dessert sauce too.  I have never been into flavored coffees before (with the exception of trying to recreate Starbuck\\'s Pumpkin Spice Latte) and now I find myself having a flavored latte every morning.  My next Amoretti syrups will be the chocolate creme and the orange cream.<br />As I told Paul on the phone, good customer service is lacking in this country and he has set the bar for excellent customer service; he could teach other companies how to treat their customers.  I probably would have thrown away the pumpkin spice syrup and never tried another Amoretti product again, but now I am a loyal customer.<br />Conclusion:  Even though I did not like the Pumpkin Spice syrup, I do not feel like I wasted my money because the company made it right and replaced it with other flavors that I love.<br />Amoretti...please consider making a true pumpkin pie creme sauce (and perhaps a white mocha creme sauce) and I will never buy another brand or need to go to Starbucks again.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z86XZY\">Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z8E0WW\">Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z7X1F0\">Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br />This tastes exactly like the red hot cinnamon candies and I ABHOR those candies.  It doesn\\'t even taste like real cinnamon but just like spicy cinnamon candy.  So I am still searching for Pumpkin Syrup.<br />I find it interesting that one other review mentioned the open cap.  Mine arrived the same way and I was hesitant about using the product because the cap came right off without breaking the plastic seal around the cap and there was no inner seal on the bottle.  The only reason I did use it was because I heard a slight vacuum sound when it opened.  Perhaps it was a false sense of security that could be due to changes in shipping elevations because typically, syrup bottles are not vacuum sealed but the company should consider an inner foil bottle seal and not rely on the cap.',\n",

This year, I switched the potting soil out for Miracle Gro Moisture Control. I flooded the planters before putting the plants in - several times. I planted them, and watered every single day from necessity. This soil product felt moist, but none was shared with the plants - their soil root balls stayed bone dry. The 2 planters in full sun had dying plants. I plunged my arm at least 25 inches down into the planters and the soil was hotter than beach sand, all the way down. This product somehow retains heat and was cooking my plants. When I removed this soil, I was surprised to find big pockets of it that were dust dry. The 2 planters in shade did a little better, but no plant growth whatsoever. Maybe if the plants grew in this from seed, they would do better, but you can't put plants in root balls into it - this soil just won't let the moisture leach into adjacent soils. And it cooks them. If your plants are still alive, rescue them and replace the soil. I don't know what this stuff is, but I would definitely not eat anything grown in it.\",\n",

Two concerns:<br />1) The amount of food prescribed is way out of line with the amount of food the dog should take in. Says for 50 lbs should be 4.5 cups, and for my 70 lb dog we fed 3 cups per the doctor, supplemented with raw veggies. The dog did not gain or lose any weight on this amount<br />2) We combined the Urinary SO 50/50 with the Renal mix - not sure why they have two. The vet cautioned about how this food will act as a diuretic, that the dog would be very thirsty and recommended we give him distilled water to drink to reduce load on the kidneys.<br /><br />What happened was instantly his poop became hard and smaller than normal. Brought it up to the vet who said this is normal. Dog drank water all the time, and did not exhibit signs of dehydration. What got dehydrated was his poop. He died of peritonitis brought on by a completely full colon because he could not get the very dry stool out of him properly. Very hard to see warning signs - he pooped twice a day, seemed a little distracted, but we had no idea his lower bowel had severly reduced movement. When he threw up undigested food four times in a row (12 hours after eating) the vet said to take him off Meloxicam for a week. Meloxicam is an NSAID arthritis drug known to cause kidney failure and ulcurs, and GI problems (bloody vomit or stools which Mikey did not have as we were watching closely for that). He stopped throwing up but I think it was coincidental timing. All these factors contributed to his death.<br /><br />Long story to say you must measure the water intake while on this food - more than keeping the bowl full. This food is VERY dehydrating.

We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I\\'ve been singing its praises, I\\'m sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren\\'t going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don\\'t normally have that fake finish.  It\\'s the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can\\'t imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It\\'s a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don\\'t find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we\\'ve also tried out a few of Keurig\\'s other offerings.  It\\'s really hit-and-miss in terms of what you\\'ll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G\">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.

One of the few Green Mountain cups that I\\'ve tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE\">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we\\'ve tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn\\'t weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don\\'t like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW\">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I\\'m Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton\\'s coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn\\'t work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig\\'s own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It\\'s definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can\\'t go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can\\'t wait to try out the new pods we\\'re set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig\\'s website.',\n",

I've honestly never seen her that excited about a treat.

If you don't like any of those characteristics, then this review won't do much for you.  Anyway, I'm pretty tired of Starbucks.  It's overly roasted, almost to a burnt sensation, and drips a bit too much with bitterness.  I tolerate it because most of the other coffee vendors in the area sell watered down garbage.  A little while back, Melitta was offered on Vine and I figured, why not give it a try.  Boiling water, 4 minutes in a french press, and some milk and sugar, and I'm in business.  Surprisingly, it was a great cup of coffee.  Nice depth, a lovely balanced and almost creamy texture, great roast, and not exceedingly bitter or sludgy.  The real test now is for me to do a head to head against my current favorite go-to: Illy.  I have a feeling that Melitta may hold up pretty well.\",\n",

The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here\\'s the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don\\'t really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.

The coffee isn\\'t strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.

These clearly make up at least 80% of this juice by volume. I was hoping for something with both more flavor punch and a more noticeable cherry flavor. I also prefer more carbonation than the very low level in this sparkling juice.  Instead this juice mix has a very light red or pink (blush) color due to the minimal amount of Acerola present (also called Barbados Cherry) followed by even less cherry juice.  To my taste, this juice mix has less zing and character than even a good non-alcoholic sparkling cider or sparkling grape juice.  What I look for in a sparkling beverage is a good sweet/sour contrast enhanced by the carbonation.  Instead the Switch folks have chosen to call a juice mix that is primarily apple and  grape juices \"Black Cherry\" when in fact it doesn\\'t even have the flavor intensity of a good Black Cherry soda.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this is not horrible stuff by any means. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  What you are getting is primarily the taste of apple juice and white grape juice with just a touch of cherry flavor and color. Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion (\"No Sugar Added\" and \"No Preservatives\" is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely \"natural\" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.',\n",

So as not to get too monotonous, I do like to switch things up among some of the more high protein nuts.  Consequently, upon seeing these cocoa roasted almonds, I was thrilled to try them.<br /><br />I actually love the taste of these nuts.  My comments:<br /><br />(1)  They have just enough cocoa to give them a nice sweetness without being overwhelming (and making you feel like you just consumed a week's worth of calories in a single snack).  I am not a big sweet lover which makes this characteristic appealing; To one with a big sweet-tooth or looking for an after-dinner dessert, you might find yourself disappointed with these.<br /><br />(2)  For the people that tested these in my household, the appeal was widespread.  My husband and two children (ages 2 and 5) loved them, probably even more than I.  They came to the consensus that the cocoa coating tasted a bit like an Oreo cookie.  With the lower calories and healthy protein, I am happy to have my children snack on these versus some of the other cookie/cracker options out there.<br /><br />(3)  The container is nice -- a good size and shape for holding.  It was easily managed by myself as well as my 2-year old.  The top is a screw-top which, in my opinion, is much nicer than the common flip tops.  I am uncertain as to whether the snacks stay fresher this way (the nuts did not last long enough to test it) but the top minimizes spills that can be frustrating with the flip tops.<br /><br />All in all, I would buy these again.  Further, I would recommend them to someone who likes almonds and can appreciate the mild sweetness of the cocoa coating.  If you are looking for a sweet, chocolate covered nut (like a mini milk-chocolate snickers), you will be disappointed.  This is not a candy bar but it is a great alternative snack.\",\n",

I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.

Having spent a good deal of time experimenting with different recipes to make my own cocktail cherries, I was eager to try this classic product. I very much expected to love these.  Unfortunately, I found these a little disappointing, and I thought I\\'d share a more measured evaluation with other Amazon readers.<br /><br />Visually: The Luxardo cherries look great; nearly black in color and coated in a very thick dark red syrup. They\\'re also small; maybe half the diameter of a bing cherry that you might buy in the produce aisle. I think they\\'re somewhat smaller than the commonly available cheap pink maraschino cherries.<br /><br />Aroma: They smell very nice. Like cherry soda, I guess.<br /><br />Texture: They\\'re quite firm. When you bite into them, there\\'s a slight \"pop\" before they dissolve into sugary goo. It\\'s a little weird if you\\'re expecting the texture of fruit.<br /><br />Taste: This is my big complaint. Yes, there\\'s a nice cherry flavor, but it\\'s completely overshadowed by the fact that they are SWEET. I mean unbelievably, mind-blowingly, unpleasantly SWEET. They are a mouthful of pure cherry-tinged SUGAR. I hadn\\'t quite realized this from reading the earlier reviews, and I was expecting something like a slightly sweetened natural cherry flavor. Make no mistake: this product is candy, and it no longer has any similarity to the texture and flavor of an actual cherry.<br /><br />I purchased this product to dress up our cocktails, but I don\\'t really want to drop a lump of candy into my manhattans. However I didn\\'t want to give up on this expensive product, so I\\'ve tried an experiment to try to salvage them: I\\'ve poured off most of the syrup from the bottle and topped it off with unsweetened brandy.  I\\'ll let it sit for a few days in the fridge, and then I\\'ll check back to see if they\\'re more palatable.

      "I bought this product at a local store, not from this seller.  I usually use Wellness canned food, but thought my cat was bored and wanted something new.  So I picked this up, knowing that Evo is a really good brand (like Wellness).<br /><br />It is one of the most disgusting smelling cat foods I've ever had the displeasure of using.  I was gagging while trying to put it into the bowl.  My cat took one taste and walked away, and chose to eat nothing until I replaced it 12 hours later with some dry food.  I would try another flavor of their food - since I know it's high quality - but I wouldn't buy the duck flavor again. {'POSITIVE': 0.0006274122279137373}\n"
